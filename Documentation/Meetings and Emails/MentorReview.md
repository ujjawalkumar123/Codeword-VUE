|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------|----------|
| 1  | 'Password doesn’t match' needs to be paraphrased. "Passwords do not match."                                                                              | Naveen                  | Done   |          |
| 2  | 'User is not register' also needs to be paraphrased "User is not registered."                                                                            | Naveen                  | Done   |          |
| 3  | Make sure not to give any reason for the login failure -  we will remove this later, after we confirm the process is working.  Add to GDP2 requirements. | Shivani                 |  Done      | no login failure, it is working         |
| 4  | Make a CW icon which represents codeword - yes -   and replace in the upper left corner of the navbar.   Add a new user story to MVP 3{?).               | Anurag                  |        |          |
| 5  | Add a + button to add a course                                                                                                                           | Naveen Nuggu            | Done   |          |
| 6  | Warning screen should stay  bit longer - how long?  add this requirement and your delay in seconds to the user story.                                    | Ujjawal                 |        |          |
| 7  | Instructor ability to create a course needs to be added.  Yes - but is not a part of our current MVP                                                     |                  |        |          |
| 8  | Email address should not be case sensitive – true, add to list of requirements for MVP 2.                                                                | Chaithanya              |        |          |
| 9  | Logout should be easy without going through many steps -  add an "exit door" icon to the top level navbar (MVP 3?)                                       | Sravya                  |        |          |
| 10 | There should be an icon for logout - yes - see above.                                                                                                    | Chaithanya              |        |          |
| 11 | Need to add a search icon - NEW FUNCTIONALITY - need to add a GDP 2 user story.  Talk to client - and get more details                                   | Srimai                  | Done      |   Add to gdp userStories       |
| 12 | In student Interface, Create or delete codeword set should be removed - true -  where is our sketch of the student view?                                 | Srimai                  |  Done      |   Removed      |
| 13 | It is not auto filling the details like email ID - NEW NON-CRITCAL FUNCTIONALITY -  if client wants autofill, please add user story to GDP 2.            | Vyshnavi               | Done       | Added to Userstories         |
| 14 | CRN needs to be removed - true. CRN is not in any user story.  Use our sample data - where is our sketch of the instructor view?                         | Naveen Nuggu            | Done   |          |


## We had a Client meeting on Oct, 10th with Dr. hoot along with me(Ujjawal), Anurag, Naveen Nuggu and Sravya and we demonstrated our app. Following was his suggestions after viewing everything meticulously:

### Client Comments:

| ID | Client's Comment                                                                                                                                                                                              | Developer Working on It | Status | Mentor's Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01 | Application must be light weight. So using image and storing it might slow the application.                                                                                                                   |  Srimai                        |       | True - there are no images in the user stories - remove this functionality. If client wants it, add the associated user stories to GDP 2 - do not incorporate un-specified functionality this semester.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 02 | Think about the impact on performance if we store the images.                                                                                                                                                 |                         |        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 03 | Talk with mentor, whether to add images/icons or not. It also may be expensive w.r.t space.                                                                                                                   |    Ujjawal                     |        | Where is the paper sketch you must review with your client/mentor first? Remove images - this is not part of your specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 04 | If using images/icons, it must fit and look perfectly (responsive) in mobile screen.                                                                                                                          |                         |        | DELETE all references to this new volunteer “images” functionality - as a boss, I don't like paying for work that I've not hired you to do. No one can charge for any images work - it's costing money just for the additional time it takes to review and delete un-requested features.                                                                |
| 05 | In mobile screen, Instructor is not able to view more than one courses in a single page.                                                                                                                      |Sravya                         |        | That is correct. Once course per screen is about enough. You'll typically only have 3-5 active courses - easy to scroll through. Showing all course attributes is required by the user stories for MVP 2 and MVP 3 are likely to take this much space. Team - proceed with the plan given. Modifications are non-critical and should be added to GDP2. |
| 06 | Current design looks good on large screen and bad on small screen                                                                                                                                             |                         |        | Being Mobile ready is a requirement. Remove images & scale text accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 07 | Images/icons are not important things, crucial things are that Instructor’s should be able to view Name and Course and Percentage of students retrieved the code.                                             |                         |        | SEE user stories for all information that must be displayed in the course panel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 08 | Start date is not required for the course.                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |      | Yes - and is defaulted to today. Changes to the course panel are non-critical and can be removed in GDP2. We need them to confirm critical functionality this semester.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 09 | End date of course is not required if the courses would be displayed in an order.                                                                                                                             |   Vyshnavi Yalamareddy                      |        | Yes - and we want to see it to verify defaulting. Changes to the course panel are non-critical and can be removed in GDP2. We need them to confirm critical functionality this semester.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 10 | CRN needs to be removed(Not part of specification)                                                                                                                                                            |  Anurag Kumar                       |        | Team: you must follow the user stories and use our sample data. Add creative ideas to GDP 2 for discussion only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11 | Section should be unique with the semester.                                                                                                                                                                   |                         |        | Team: Read the user stories. There is no Semester / Section / CRN - each course gets one unique string called "Course name" to identify it. We do not have term/semeester/section/crn - we have only a single, unique string.                                                                                                                           |
| 12 | There should be a unique identifier for Instructor. He/she should be able to view Course Name, Semester and Instructor’s identifier(Identifier should be randomly generated)                                  |                         |        | WHAT?? Instructors are uniquely identified by email. They get an email (the ID) and a single name field (just like all users). There is nothing about a randomly-generated identifier in our user stories for this semester. Whatever this refers to is a discussion for GDP 2.                                                                         |
| 13 | There should be some default data which can be changed later like start date can be filled with today’s date (system date) and Instructor can change the data later on.                                       |     Naveen Nuggu   |        | Yes - see our user stories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 14 | Instructor’s Name is required while creating add course in course details.                                                                                                                                    |      Naveen Chandaluri     |        | Why is this critical? It is not in our current user stories and should be deferred to GDP 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This is the obvious and efficient approach. If an instructor deletes a student during an active course, we are fine. If they add a student and they correctly selected a codeword set with more words than students, they are fine. If a (non-forward-thinking) instructor assigns an 80-count codeword set to a course with 80 students, and tries to add one, it will violate the course creation rules as defined in our current user stories. The (non-forward-thinking) instructor will be unable to add a student if they cannont assign them a codeword. They will have to wait til a student drops or plan better next time. |

### Extra Comments:
1. Rules for creating codewords" are part of GDP 2 - use the discussions to begin building your GDP 2 requirements and user stories.
2. This semester, record all details you can get about "rules for creating codewords" and maintain the associated user stories and requirements in your GDP 2 plan (which is due this semester).
3. Part of the team can work on developing these requirements, but be sure to keep your focus on MVP2 and MVP3 design/sketch and development. We need to get the critical behaviors implemented fully first - and then tune appearance and additional features, etc. Create Codewords Client Comments
