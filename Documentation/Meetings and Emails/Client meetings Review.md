| 09/13/2018 | 1. In the Sketches, he asked us to give email as the userID for login in the Login page 2. In the register page, default password should be a codeword 3. In the Instructor Login page add new course should be on the left top of the page 4. The instructor should add new code words 5. We should provide a default codewords 6. Provide a detailed hint in new Couse page 7. When uploading the student list show that in the sample database; 8. Make less number of clicks 9. In the student page instead, add a drop-down 10. We have to ad table to display all the courses we have taken 11. In the table next to the course taken display the codeword for those the student had generated 12. Not to show all the er diagrams in the presentation 13. Remove the relation between student and administrator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 09/26/2018 | 1. Code words are randomly assigned to students.  Each student must get a unique code word.   2. There should be at least two code sets available - The standard 88 and a larger set of at least twice the size. 3. Instructors need the ability to add/remove students from a class. 4. Check # of students against the size of the code set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 09/28/2018 |  1.04 - As a student, I want to see my current courses and acknowledge my random codeword for the respective course on my home page. 2.01 - As an instructor, I want to check an "Instructor?" box when I register so that I can distribute code words.[Don't want this point as an option as this is an admin option-Dr. Hoot] 2.02 - As an instructor, I want to see my list of all active courses, those are “active” today between the start and end date inclusively. (Which would be after 4 months of start date)[Poor English-Dr. Hoot] 2.03 - As an instructor, I want to create a new set of code words by entering a unique name for the codeword set and uploading an Excel sheet(.csv), Word doc or plain text file that would contain a new list of codewords. 2.04 - Why there would be parenthesis and when do the instructor will see this? Also, this point is covered in next to the next point - Dr. Hoot 2.05 - Instructors would not be having access to delete codeword sets. 2.06 - Survey URL is optional and As an Instructor, I should be able to change the URL ~ can be deferred in the next sprint 2.08 - If Instructor accidentally delete the course, he/she should be able to view that deleted course in Inactive course section and should be able to undo that delete 3.01 - Whenever a student is added to a course, random cord should be assigned to them 3.03 - I won't be able to know what codeword is assigned to which student as the codewords should be confidential.

| 10/05/2018 | 1. 'Password doesn’t match' needs to be paraphrased. 2. 'User is not registered' also needs to be paraphrased 4. Make sure not to give any reason for the login failure 5. Make a CW icon which represents a codeword 6. Add a + button to add a course 7. Warning screen should stay bit longer 8. Instructor ability to create a course needs to be added. 9. An email address should not be case sensitive 10. Logout should be easy without going through many steps 11. There should be an icon for logout 12. Need to add a search icon 13. In student Interface, Create or delete codeword set should be removed 14. It is not auto-filling the details like email ID 15.

| 10/10/2018 | 1) An application must be lightweight. So using an image and storing it might slow the application. 2) Think about the impact on performance if we store the images. 3) Talk with a mentor, whether to add images/icons or not. It also may be expensive w.r.t space. 4) If using images/icons, it must fit and look perfectly (responsive) in mobile screen. 5) In mobile screen, Instructor is not able to view more than one courses in a single page. 6) Current design looks good on a large screen and bad on the small screen 7) Images/icons are not important things, crucial things are that instructors should be able to view Name and Course and Percentage of students retrieved the code. 8) Start date is not required for the course. 9) End date, of course, is not required if the courses would be displayed in an order. 10) CRN needs to be removed(Not part of the specification) 12) There should be a unique identifier for Instructor. He/she should be able to view Course Name, Semester and Instructor’s identifier(Identifier should be randomly generated) 13) There should be some default data which can be changed later like start date can be filled with today’s date (system date) and Instructor can change the data later on. 14) Instructor’s Name is required while creating add course in course details. 15) There must be two survey URL, pre and post. Currently, there is only one URL which should not be a default and should not force Instructor to use that URL only(Instructor should have access to change the URL) 16) Start and End date should be viewed by both Instructor and Students but after the end date, Instructor should still be able to view the dates which students cannot see after the end date. 17) There should be some kind of checkbox to indicate show courses that are expired. 18) The view should look OK in both portraits as well as in landscape mode. Create Code words: 19) Each code-word must be different from one another by at least 2 letters and they should not be like the same. 20) Code-words should be of 4-5 letters at least. 21) An instructor should be able to know the matrix used to select the code-words. 22) Instead of a CLOSE button, there should be a CANCEL button. It should be CANCEL and CREATE. 23) There should be only one way of canceling the model. There is no need of (X) at the top right corner to cancel the model ( Talk to mentor regarding this) 24) Display cards for the code-words. 25) Code-words that are approved should not be allowed to be changed and If that would be the case then what should be in the case of Instructor’s own code-word set(He/she would be allowed to change/delete his/her own code-word set or not? – Talk to mentor for this) 26) When does the assignment of code-word taking place? ( Dr. Hoot) 27) Assign code-word randomly when the Course is created(At the time of creation of code-word set – Talk to mentor for this) |
| 11/30/2018 | 1) Hint: There should not be a single letter difference. In the 5th hint, use should be instead of will be. Remove hint 4. 2) Delete button in the codeword tab should be on the right side of the screen. 3) User story 2.05: Duplicates needs to be validated. When an incorrect URL is entered, it needs to be warned. Make error messages consistent with fields. Student email address needs to be unique. 4) Name of the course and percentage of the students accepted should be on the dashboard 5) With the title percentage should be included. 6) When clicked on edit, system should take only the complete valid email address. 7) For acknowledge status, the format should be as per the example: 9/17. 8) Delete few acceptance criteria 9) User story 3.01: End data and instructors email should be included in student dashboard. |
