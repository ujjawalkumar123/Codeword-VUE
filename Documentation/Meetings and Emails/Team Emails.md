Subject: Task assignment of mentor's review comments and MVP2 presentation work.

Hello Team,

Mentor’s meeting markdown file has been created under Documents in Developer branch and all the comments provided by Dr. Case on Dr. hoot’s feedback is there in tabular form. Now, each team member has to put their names for the feedback for which they are working upon so that it can be documented under column “Developer’s working on it” and we can have a transparent record of everyone who is working on what and also please let the team know once the task would be completed so that State can be changed from “In progress” to “Done”. 

Please find below link for the same:
https://github.com/chvnaveenkumar/CodeWord/blob/Developer/Documentation/Meetings%20and%20Emails/MentorReview.md

Addition to that, we also have MVP2 presentation on Oct 26th in VLK 111 for which calendar invite is already sent to whole team but still many of you didn’t accepted the invite. Please do that ASAP. Moreover, the person responsible for Acceptance criteria have to make sure that everything is documented in our cloud repo and also there should not be anything missing at the time of presentation.

Apart from all these, please let the team know if anyone wants to speak on any topic in MVP2 presentation.

Kind Regards,
Ujjawal Kumar
